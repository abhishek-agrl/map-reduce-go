# Master Node - Orchestration Node for MapReduce

## Setup
1) Complete basic setup of Google Cloud Storage and Worker-Node
2) Make sure you have Go v1.21
3) Run command - ```go mod tidy```
4) Copy your ```google_cloud_credentials.json``` to the folder
5) (optional) If you are using a different method to run worker nodes, You need to modify ```getWorkerNodes``` function in  ```gcs_helper.go``` and return the address of your nodes
6) For a better experience, I recommend running the code in VS Code in the run and debug section (Make sure you run and debug while on the ```main.go``` file)
7) Your Master-Node server should be up and running!

## Usage
In your browser visit ```localhost:8080``` and there are 3 routes you can access -

1) ```/mapreduce``` - starts the map reduce workflow
2) ```/cleanup``` - deletes the intermediate files generated manually
3) ```/output``` - displays the latest output generated by the system
